The idea of this project is to use GDELT Project data to identify events and collect other data, based on the event such as twitter and facebook data. With this data collected, we will try to identify what factors before a protest may lead it to become violent and predict if new protests will become violent.

The main data source is the GDELT Project. GDELT 2.0 is available using Google BigQuery and collects various information on events in human history. One example of helpful data is a URL collection of "mentions" which will allow us to access vast amounts of text data connected to the event. The size of the entire GDELT Project Database is 2.5 Terabytes, however, we would only be focusing on the last 15 years.



Currently we are still exploring the data and the tools to create a comprehensive design for the final project.
